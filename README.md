The scope is this project was to create a responsive website using the Tailwind CSS framework.

I created the responsive website by following a tutorial by the YouTube channel The Net Ninja
Link to tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxmDnn7lrnk&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gpXORlEHjc5bgnIi5HEGhw&ab_channel=TheNetNinja

I followed every step of the tutorial and built an identical website to the one that was built in the tutorial.
Whenever the tutor did something I didn't understand, I would look that up and get an understanding of it, before continuing the tutorial.

I know that following a tutorial is very hand-held, but I did get a very good grasp of how Tailwind works and which possibilities you get with the framework.
After having finished the tutorial, I would have liked to tweak the website a bit to give it a more personal touch and experiment a bit, but unfortunately I did not have time for this.
